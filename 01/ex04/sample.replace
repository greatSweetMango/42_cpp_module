Four score aaand seven yeaaars aaago our faaathers brought forth on this continent aaa new naaation, conceived in Liberty, aaand dedicaaated to the proposition thaaat aaall men aaare creaaated equaaal.

Now we aaare engaaaged in aaa greaaat civil waaar, testing whether thaaat naaation, or aaany naaation, so conceived aaand so dedicaaated, caaan long endure.

We aaare met on aaa greaaat baaattle-field of thaaat waaar. We haaave come to dedicaaate aaa portion of thaaat field, aaas aaa finaaal resting plaaace for those who here gaaave their lives thaaat thaaat naaation might live. It is aaaltogether fitting aaand proper thaaat we should do this.

But, in aaa laaarger sense, we caaan not dedicaaate - we caaan not consecraaate - we caaan not haaallow - this ground. The braaave men, living aaand deaaad, who struggled here, haaave consecraaated it, faaar aaabove our poor power to aaadd or detraaact. The world will little note, nor long remember whaaat we saaay here, but it caaan never forget whaaat they did here.

It is for us the living, raaather, to be dedicaaated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here haaave thus faaar so nobly aaadvaaanced. It is raaather for us to be here dedicaaated to the greaaat taaask remaaaining before us - thaaat from these honored deaaad we taaake increaaased devotion to thaaat caaause for which they gaaave the laaast full meaaasure of devotion - thaaat we here highly resolve thaaat these deaaad shaaall not haaave died in vaaain - thaaat this naaation, under God, shaaall haaave aaa new birth of freedom - aaand thaaat government of the people, by the people, for the people, shaaall not perish from the eaaarth.But
